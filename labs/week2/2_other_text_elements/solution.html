      This is a bunch of body text. <strong>In the HTML file</strong>, this text
      sits on a single line because text editors commonly don't have word wrap.
      If your editor does have word wrap, the text will appear in the "margins"
      created by thw window size of your editor. In your browser, the text is
      word wrapped and there's no 'added' space between the lines inside of the
      paragraph, but there is added space between the paragraphs.

      That's because of the <em>default style value</em> that's written into
      your browser that adds one 1em (16 pixels) of vertical space between
      paragraphs.

      Metaphors are important to our understanding because they create concrete
      examples that we can use to understand abstract processes.

    <blockquote>
      The desktop metaphor is characterized by windows and hierarchy of folders.
      A computer screen contains many windows, and each window hosts an
      application. Users can open, resize and minimize a window, move its
      content by scrolling, find actions to perform on the drop-down menu, and
      move the window around to see other windows. Beneath all the windows is
      the desktop folder. A folder contains references to other folders and
      files, which are documents for storing information; users can copy, paste
      and move around files and folders to organize them.
